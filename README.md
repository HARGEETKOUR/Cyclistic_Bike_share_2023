# Cyclistic_Bike_share_Case_Study_2023
## üìöINTRODUCTION
The project **Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study** is the Capstone project of the [GOOGLE DATA ANALYTICS PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) In this project, I will use the steps and strategies learned from the course to answer the questions of stakeholders. The Steps that I will use are: <ins>Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act.</ins>
## üìùSCENARIO
Being a junior Data Analyst, I am working on a Marketing Analyst team in the company **Cyclistic, a bike-share
company in Chicago**.
##  üìúABOUT THE COMPANY
Cyclists, a leading bike-share company based in Chicago, has achieved remarkable success since its inception in 2016. The program has expanded exponentially, boasting an impressive fleet of 5,824 bicycles and a comprehensive network of 692 tracked stations strategically located throughout the city. This extensive infrastructure enables users to effortlessly rent bicycles from one station and return them to any other station within the network, promoting cycling as a convenient and appealing mode of transportation.

Cyclistic's marketing strategy has traditionally focused on building broad awareness and catering to diverse consumer segments through flexible pricing plans. These plans include single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships, ensuring users can choose the best option. Moreover, the company has demonstrated a commitment to inclusivity by offering adaptive bicycles, such as reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, to accommodate individuals with disabilities and those who require alternative cycling options.

According to Cyclistic's user data, most users leverage the bike-sharing program for leisure activities, while approximately 30% rely on the service for their daily commute to work. Interestingly, traditional bicycles remain the most popular choice, although around 8% of users opt for the adaptive alternatives.

In light of these insights, Cyclistic's marketing director has identified a key opportunity for growth: maximizing the number of annual memberships. To achieve this goal, my team and I, as junior data analysts, have been tasked with conducting an in-depth analysis of the usage patterns and behaviors of both casual riders and annual members. By uncovering these two user groups' distinct characteristics and preferences, we will develop a targeted marketing strategy to convert casual riders into loyal annual members, further solidifying Cyclistic's position as a leading bike-share company.
## üîçANALYSING PROCESS...**
### 1. ASK
**Goal of the project**: Design marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members by analyzing the key difference between casual riders and members and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.<br>
>Questions to be answered for the goal:
> 1.  How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
> 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
> 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

**Task Assigned**: "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"<br>
